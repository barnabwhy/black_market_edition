Thank you for installing Black Market Edition!

Open Titanfall as you normally do and enjoy!

You can also use the Titanfall_alt.exe alternate launcher in the game directory if you run into any issues with the original Titanfall.exe.

The mod will automatically check for updates when you start the game, once any updates are available (you can disable it with -bmenoupdates or -bmeoffline command line switches if you wish).
